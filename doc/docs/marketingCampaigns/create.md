## 📝 Step 1: Campaign Details

In the **Details** tab, you need to fill in the general information about your campaign:

- **Campaign Title**: A short and descriptive name.
- **Description**: A brief explanation of the campaign's goal.
- **Status**: You can set it to `active`, `inactive`, or `completed`.

## 🔗 Step 2: Connections

The **Connections** tab allows you to define which clients and team members are involved.

- **Tags**: Select one or more tags that group your clients by interests or categories.
- **Team Members**: Assign collaborators who will help manage the campaign.

The clients matching the selected tags will form the audience.

## 👥 Step 3: Audience Preview

In the **Audience Preview** tab, you can:

- View the **estimated reach**, i.e., the number of clients who will receive the ads.
- See a **preview list** of up to 10 clients that match the tags you selected.

> Note: If no tags are selected, no audience will be shown.

## ✅ Final Step: Submit the Campaign

Once you're ready:

- Click **"Create Campaign"** in the Campaign Summary section.
- The campaign will be created and saved in the system.
- A corresponding audience will be generated based on the tags.

If everything is successful, a confirmation dialog will appear, and you'll be redirected back to the campaign list.
