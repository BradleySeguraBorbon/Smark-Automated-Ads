# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

Here are the most common questions and issues users encounter when using AutoSmark:

---

### 💬 Why aren’t any clients showing up in the campaign audience?

Make sure that:

- You have assigned at least one **tag** to the campaign.
- There are clients in the system with **matching tags**.
- You are connected to the internet and authenticated properly.

> Tip: You can preview the estimated audience in the **Audience Preview** tab.

---

### ⚙️ Why can’t I generate placeholders using AI?

The AI assistant requires the following:

- A **message name** must be set.
- A **marketing campaign** must be selected.
- A **template** must be selected for the current channel (email or telegram).
- The campaign must be **accessible** by your user account.

> If any of these fields are missing, the “Generate Placeholders” button will show an error.

---

### ✉️ Why was my message not sent?

Possible reasons:

- The message’s **send date** is not within the campaign's start and end dates.
- There is no valid **audience** (no clients matched).
- The campaign or message was not set to **active**.
- There was a **server or scheduling error** during message execution (check logs if available).

---

### 🧩 Can I preview my email or Telegram content?

Yes. Each template-based message has:

- A real-time **email preview** showing layout, subject, and attachments.
- A **Telegram preview** rendered using Markdown with button simulation.

---

### 📎 How do I add attachments to emails?

In the **Email Content** tab:

1. Scroll down to the "Attachments" section.
2. Provide a name (e.g., `promo.pdf`) and a file path or URL.
3. Click the ➕ button to add it.

They will appear in the preview and be listed in the final message.

---

### 🗓 Can I send messages outside the campaign date range?

No. The **send date must fall between the campaign's start and end date**. If not, you’ll be asked to adjust it.

---

### 🚀 Can I reuse the same template for different messages?

Absolutely. Templates are reusable and can be used across multiple messages and campaigns. Each message customizes its placeholders independently.

---

### 🤖 Does AI replace my content?

No. The AI tool **suggests placeholder values** and optionally fills the email subject. You can always modify the results manually before sending.
